------- general information on how to run EViS ------------
python version : 2
gcc: gcc-8.3.0

EViS virtual screening program needs two consecutive steps (please ensure
the last step was completed before running the next step):

        1, prepare the compounds (MOL2 format) and pocket ('.POC' format) into the input folder
        2, runEViS.py
        

1. prepare the input files

put all compounds (MOL2 format) into /EViS/user_input/results_docking/ligand_mol2/
put the pocket file (named as "nativepocket.poc") into the /EViS/user_input/results_docking/pocket/
The pocket is like as:

POC     nativepocket
ATOM    253  N   VAL A  49       6.937   3.497 -28.457  1.00 34.68           N
ATOM    254  CA  VAL A  49       6.465   2.179 -28.887  1.00 34.68           C
ATOM    255  C   VAL A  49       5.665   2.297 -30.179  1.00 34.68           C
ATOM    256  O   VAL A  49       5.965   1.651 -31.192  1.00 34.68           O
...
TRE 

2. run EViS
For exmpleï¼š
cd /EViS/webserver/script/
python runEViS.py

input:
    ligands_mol2: all ligands with MOL2 format which are from docking.
    pocket: nativepocket.poc, the first line is named as "POC   pocket"
Note:
    If you want to change the pocket size, please modify in line 11 of "ppsalign.py".
    The defalut valuse is "POC", you can change as "POC_6A", "POC_7A" and "POC_8A".
output: 
    The pocket similarity result is saved as pocket_topN.info in "pocket" folder. 
    The ligand similarity score results are saved in the "ligand_mol2" folder.
    The PLscore.result into the /EViS/user_input/results_docking/
